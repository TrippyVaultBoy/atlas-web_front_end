Cookies and Local Storage (Max's Version):

This project's goal is to give us a bsic introduction to cookies, local and session storage as well as how to manipulate tghen with Javascript.

I chose to use the Live Server extension for vscode.

Task 0:
    Create a basic login page to store a firstname and email with cookies.

Task 1:
    Expand task 0 to make the cookies expire after 10 days.

Task 2:
    Expand task 1 to include a getCookie function which returns the value of the
    coresponding cookie name.

Task 3:
    Expand task 2 to create a sudo login page. If login credentials are not saved a simple login form will be displayed, if not a welcome message and logout button will display.

Task 4:
    Expand task 3 to use js-cookie using jsdelivr CDN instead of our custom functions

Task 5:
    Create a simple shopping cart application using browser local storage

Task 6:
    reuse the application from Task 5 but use brower session storage instead of local storage

Task 7:
    Expand on Task 6 to add removable items from the cart as well as a clear cart button.
